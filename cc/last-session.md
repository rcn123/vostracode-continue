  Phase 1 (Now):
  - Point everything to your backend → vLLM
  - ✅ Chat works
  - ✅ Apply works
  - ✅ Autocomplete works (good enough)
  - ✅ All Continue features work (agents, MCP, refactoring, etc.)
  - ✅ One simple config

  Phase 2 (Later):
  - Add custom provider for Tabby
  - Route only autocomplete to Tabby
  - Keep everything else on vLLM
  - Best of both worlds

  Let's clean up and simplify:

  1. Revert our OpenAI.ts hacks - Remove Tabby transformation
  2. Point to your backend/vLLM - Single endpoint for everything
  3. Document the setup - Note that Tabby integration is future work

  Your backend can handle:
  - SSO/auth
  - Usage tracking
  - Rate limiting
  - Model routing (maybe Tabby for autocomplete later)
  - Cost management

  This is much cleaner than hacking Continue's internals. Want me to revert our changes and set up the simple vLLM config?
