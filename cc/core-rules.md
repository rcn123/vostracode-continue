General and important coding rules. 

- Write code that is modular and testable, no big bang, no too large functions/methods. Better break them down to testable components/functions
- No bells and whistles, keep it simple, simple as possible. 
- Do not write code/bonus code that I have not asked for (typical case, fall-back solutions and timeout)
- After every set of code changes, before returning control to the user, output a concise 1-line commit message that the user can copy and use for git commits.
- Remove the "ðŸ¤– Generated with Claude Code" from all future commit messages
- Sometimes I write "paste.txt", "paste" or just "p". This means, please read cc/paste.txt, there are probably log or console output I want to get your help with
- Its important that you read and understand cc/patch-workflow.md and cc/repository-setup.md to understand the ways of working here
- There is a document called cc/last-session.txt. In the beginning it has a SessionDate. Its relevant to read this document if its SessionDate is today or yesterday, else just ignore it
