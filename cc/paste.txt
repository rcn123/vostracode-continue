Yep â€” thatâ€™s the catch ðŸ‘‡

Agent/Plan modes in Continue need tool calling.

Two ways to get it:

Native tool calling (OpenAI GPT-4.1, GPT-4-Turbo, etc. â†’ real tools: [] in API).

System-message tools (Continue fakes tool support by stuffing tool descriptions into the system message and parsing back JSON).

Qwen-2.5-Coder doesnâ€™t implement OpenAIâ€™s function-calling schema out of the box. So Continue has no clue it can call tools â†’ you must flip on experimental system-message tools.

Thatâ€™s exactly why in the config you add:

experimental:
  onlyUseSystemMessageTools: true


or in vc-default.ts:

experimental: {
  onlyUseSystemMessageTools: true,
}
