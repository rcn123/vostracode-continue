Found Cloud Dependencies in VostraCode:

1. API Keys in Workflows (Already addressed)

- Multiple cloud LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, etc.)
- VS Code marketplace tokens
- JetBrains marketplace tokens

2. PostHog Analytics

- Used for telemetry/analytics
- Found in multiple files

3. Free Trial/Licensing System

- Already have vc-freetrial.ts override

4. Potential Cloud URLs

- Continue.com/continuedev.com references
- Authentication endpoints
- Subscription/trial checks

5. Marketplace Publishing (Already disabled)

Recommendations:

1. PostHog telemetry - Should be disabled for privacy
2. Free trial checks - Already overridden with your vc-freetrial.ts
3. Cloud LLM tests - Already skipped with IGNORE_API_KEY_TESTS
4. Marketplace publishing - Already disabled

Would you like me to disable PostHog telemetry to ensure no data leaves your infrastructure?
