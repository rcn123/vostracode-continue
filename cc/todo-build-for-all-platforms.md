My Strong Recommendation:

Use GitHub Actions to build platform-specific VSIXs automatically. Then distribute:

- vostracode-1.0.0-win32-x64.vsix for Windows
- vostracode-1.0.0-linux-x64.vsix for Linux
- vostracode-1.0.0-darwin-x64.vsix for macOS

Users download the right one for their platform. 100% plug-and-play, zero configuration,
professional appearance.

Would you like me to set up the GitHub Actions workflow for automated multi-platform builds?

Professional Solution: Platform-Specific VSIX Packages

Option 1: Build on Windows (Most Reliable)

Set up a Windows VM or use a Windows machine to build the Windows VSIX. This guarantees
correct binaries.

Option 2: GitHub Actions CI/CD (Best Long-term)

Create .github/workflows/build-vsix.yml:

name: Build VSIX for All Platforms
on:
push:
tags: ['v*']

jobs:
build:
strategy:
matrix:
include: - os: windows-latest
platform: win32-x64
name: windows - os: ubuntu-latest
platform: linux-x64
name: linux - os: macos-latest
platform: darwin-x64
name: macos

      runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}

      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
          with:
            node-version: 20

        - run: npm install
        - run: npm run build
        - run: npx vsce package --target ${{ matrix.platform }}

        - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
          with:
            name: vsix-${{ matrix.name }}
            path: '*.vsix'

This builds native VSIXs on actual target platforms.
